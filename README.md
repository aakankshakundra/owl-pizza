## IMPORTANT

This is the `template` branch. It only contains a wireframe that doesn't include the actual Twilio Notify code. For a working verison switch to the `master` branch.
This template is purely used as a starting point for a workshop to implement Twilio Notify.

## About

This is a project to show different functionality of [Twilio Notify](https://www.twilio.com/notify) and [Ionic 2](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/). It consists of a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) server and an Ionic app.
